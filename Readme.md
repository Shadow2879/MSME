This project looks into exploring the distribution of MSME (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises ) in certain areas of interest for India.


Data about the location of MSMEs was downloaded from [open government data platform](https://www.data.gov.in/)

Data for pincode boundaries in and around Bangalore was obtained using a local docker [nominatim](https://nominatim.org/) server.

Data for some pincode boundaries that were unavailable from Nominatim were taken from [PincodeBoundary](https://github.com/datameet/PincodeBoundary) github repo.

Data for administrative areas was downloaded from [GADM](https://gadm.org/data.html) for India but did not have pincode boundary resolution for visualising MSME concentration and was not used.
